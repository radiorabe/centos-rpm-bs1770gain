This repo is archived due to us switching to a r128 gain implementation that is not politically loaded with fucked up alt-right rhetoric. Peter, [fuck you and the dedication of your software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgZj23G9wrI).

Radio Bern RaBe stands for a multicultural Europe and we do not want to have anything to do with the vile type of programmer that uses his opensource contributions as a soapbox for racist propaganda.

Any users of this package are kindly asked to consider using https://github.com/slhck/ffmpeg-normalize or a similar piece of software.
